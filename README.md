# NWChem Tutorial: Calculating NMR Chemical Shift Values

## Overview
Welcome to the NWChem Tutorial for calculating Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shift values! In this tutorial, I will explore how NWChem, a powerful computational chemistry software suite, can be utilized to calculate NMR chemical shifts of chemical compounds.

## Introduction
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique for chemical identification in complex samples. Traditionally, researchers rely on databases containing chemical shift spectra to match experimental NMR data with known compounds. However, building comprehensive libraries of authentic standards experimentally can be challenging and time-consuming.

To overcome these limitations, computational chemistry approaches offer a practical solution. By utilizing NWChem, a widely-used software suite for quantum chemistry calculations, we can perform in silico calculations to determine molecular attributes such as NMR chemical shifts. This enables us to expand reference libraries and enhance compound identification in metabolomics studies.

## Installation

### Installation Steps
1. Open the terminal.
2. Update your package list by running the following command:
   ```shell
   sudo apt update
3. Install NWChem by running the following command:
   ```shell
   sudo apt install nwchem
If you encounter any issues or want to install NWChem using a different method, please refer to the official NWChem website for detailed instructions: [NWChem Download Page](https://nwchemgit.github.io/Download.html#nwchem-availability-in-linux-distributions)

4. Verify the installation by running the following command to check the NWChem version:
  ```shell
  nwchem --version
  ```
This should display the version information if NWChem is installed correctly.

5. Congratulations! You have successfully installed NWChem on your system.
